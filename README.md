## Overview

The AutoAuto AI project aims to develop a pedestrian detection system for autonomous vehicles. The system detects pedestrians using camera sensors, alerts them with a honk, and maneuvers the vehicle safely to avoid collisions. It also recognizes stop signs and ensures the vehicle halts for safety.

## Features

- Pedestrian detection using camera sensors.
- Alerts pedestrians via honking.
- Randomized decision-making for safe navigation.
- Stops the vehicle upon detecting stop signs.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning
- Image Recognition
- Autonomous Systems
